Bank project with PHP

This is my first exam project for web dev.

When handed in I had the page for a user ready, after handing in I created an admin page to see all users and manage them.

To login as regular user:
phone: 31111111 password: 1234

To login as admin:
Go to URL with /admin as the following: http://lindedesigns.dk/bank-new/admin AFTER logging in as regular user.

The chat is made in a very simple way and in order to see it working do the following:

1. Open 2 seperate windows in preferably different browsers
2. Login with the 31111111 on one browser and 29647715 (same password!) on the other. 
3. Type the opposite phone nr in field and write a message.
- Should be working! :)
